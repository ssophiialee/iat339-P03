            <h2>I want to create memorable experiences through unconstraint ways of storytelling in design.</h2>
            <p>My name is Sophia Lee and I am a joint major student at Simon Fraser University, studying interactive art + technology and communications. I intend to concentrate in design and media + technology. I believe that we live in the world of synergy. With my specialties, I wish to make the world we live a little bit better. If you wanna chat, I would love the chance to get to know you too! - <a href = "contact.html" class = "in-text-link">contact me</a>.
